      <description>netSEC News I was recently asked by a colleague of mine who just graduated university and started their first full time Security Analyst gig where I get my netSEC News.
Instead of blasting away in Slack with an intermittent stream of links and commentary I thought it would be more beneficial to create a simple and concise blog post containing my current Top 5 sources.
I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in where other security professionals get their news from.</description>

      <description>All Logs Go To Heaven It&amp;rsquo;s 9:00 PM. Do you know where your logs are? Hopefully in the cloud, far away from the grease smeared, Miller High-Life soaked fingers of the local datacenter sputz who is one brainzap away from disappearing your logs from existence.
Sending your logs to the cloud can be a solution if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or convenience of maintaining on premises infrastructure that can be costly and time consuming to maintain.</description>
